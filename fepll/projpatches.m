function [img, norm] = projpatches(patches, M, N, mask)
% % Function Name: projpatches (calls projpatches.c)

% Inputs:
%   patches    : image patches
%   M          : number of rows of original image
%   N          : number of columns of original image

%
% Outputs:
%   img        : image created by arraging the patches w.r.t mask
